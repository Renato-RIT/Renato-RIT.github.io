              <h3>About Us</h3>
              <span class="terminal-prompt">Resolution IT was launch in 2022 because our founder, Renato Lopes, was tired of watching companies, IT Managers and business owners struggling 
                with ineffective and dated IT solutions. Our passion for providing the best quality end-to-end solutions from strategy to deployment and beyond, has provided Resolution IT a 
                sustainable growth since the founding. With a consistent retention rate and an uptime percentage that is as near perfect as you can get, we believe our work speaks on our behalf.
                 Our enterprise IT services are extended to several corporate sectors and vertical markets, but we have achieved such a great success providing solutions in the Retail & 
                 Financial sectors specifically. Over time we have also invested and formed product relationships with large-scale software and product houses which enables us to add value to
                our clients and provide the best in market IT solutions</span>
